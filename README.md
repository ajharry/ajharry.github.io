## Current Research and Activities
I am currently participating in the Insight Data Science Fellowship Program in Seattle, WA. My project is sponView, a web app that uses Natural Language Processing techniques to identify sponsored content in YouTube videos. Learn about my project [here](http://www.sponview.site).

Here is my [resume](April_Harry_Resume.pdf).

## Past Research
My dissertation research involved developing statistical methods for complex, spatially correlated data called mass spectrometry images. In particular, I developed a Bayesian modeling and testing framework for the  identification of differentially abundant ions across sample conditions. This work was interdisciplinary, involving both bioinformatics and spatial statistics. I was advised by Prof. Olga Vitek. I graduated from Purdue University Statistics in December 2017, having completed my thesis work as a Research Technician in the College of Science at Northeastern University in Boston, MA.

I am passionate about helping to increase access, success, and visibility of underrepresented minorities in STEM, particularly in the mathematical sciences. I was also an advisor for Statistics in the Community (StatCom) at Purdue, a student-run organization that provides free statistical consulting to local non-profits, schools, and governmental agencies.
